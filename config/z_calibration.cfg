[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.
switch_xy_position:
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the Z endstop.
bed_xy_position: default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#   a X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the relative
#   reference index at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset:
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   Larger values will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This needs to be find out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 1.0
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
samples: default from "probe:samples" section
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: default from "probe:samples_tolerance" section
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: default from "probe:samples_tolerance_retries" section
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: default from "probe:samples_result" section
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
clearance: 2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 50
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
